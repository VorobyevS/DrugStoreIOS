# DrugStoreIOS
It's my course project.
IOSDrugStore app with azure mobile back end.
DrugStoreIOS(client) - ios app with Xamarin.IOS
DrugStoreMAC(admin tool) - mac app with Xamarin.MAC

Sample how to work with azure mobile services.

Here u can find:
- how to work with azure mobile service
- how to connect
- how to invoke api async/sync
- how to get/send information to azure mobile back end

And ofcourse it's full Xamarin.IOS which means it's C# language not Obj-c or Swift.
